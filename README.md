# AnonAsk
## About :-


This is the project based on Next.js Framework in typescript. The best part of it is that frontend and backend both are written in the same Framework which takes integration and synchronisation at another level.
        
Most of the times if a student tends to asks question. He is unable to do it because he is scared of what others will think of him. To solve this real time problem I present you AnonAsk.
    
I remember when I first took my DSA class. My teacher asked if we could use Discord to interact with students in the class and solve our own doubts. He tried to implement it but was unable to do so due to the technalities involved in it. In order to solve this problem Ipresent you with the app called AnonAsk.

This app lets students ask anonymous questions in the classroom.
